This application was created in 2017 more for personal use than anything. It was for tracking progress in video games and gave me some good experience working with APIs and loading images.

I don't intend to update this repository much, but there's a chance I may come back to it someday. But it may be easier to just start over since I didn't follow any design patterns at all, since it was before I learned them.
